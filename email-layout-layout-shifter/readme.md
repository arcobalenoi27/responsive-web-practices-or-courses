#Responsive practice - Email Layout - Layout Shifter
###it is a Email Layout using Layout Shifter.
Try to build an Email layout using the concept of responsive web design  pattern. 
I use Layout Shifter pattern this time. And I use pure CSS to build this simple blog-like site, but I use the normalize.css to reset the default style.
